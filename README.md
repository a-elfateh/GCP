# GCP
A repo containting mini projects and guided tutorials on the Google Cloud Platform

As always, I like to segregate my repos into sub-topics, with each topic containing related services and documents.

## Topics:
1. Networking
   - [Private Google Access]([https://github.com/a-elfateh/GCP](https://github.com/a-elfateh/GCP/blob/main/docs/1-%20Networking/Private%20Google%20Access.md)https://github.com/a-elfateh/GCP/blob/main/docs/1-%20Networking/Private%20Google%20Access.md)
