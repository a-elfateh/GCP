#Hosting a DNS Server on a GCP Compute Instance:
Hosting a DNS server on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine instance versus using a private hosted zone in GCP’s Cloud DNS are two different approaches to managing DNS, each with its own advantages and use cases. Here’s a quick overview of considerations before choosing:

**Control:** Hosting on a GCP Compute Instance provides full control and customization, while GCP’s Cloud DNS offers a managed service with less flexibility.
**Maintenance:** Hosting your own DNS server requires more maintenance, whereas GCP’s Cloud DNS is maintained by Google.
**Scalability and Reliability:** GCP Cloud DNS scales automatically and offers high reliability, while a self-hosted DNS server requires manual scaling and configuration for high availability.
**Integration:** GCP Cloud DNS integrates seamlessly with other GCP services, making it easier to manage DNS in a GCP-centric environment.

#When to Choose Each

Host on **Compute Engine** if you need custom DNS configurations, advanced features, or tight integration with non-GCP systems.

Use **Cloud DNS** if you prefer a managed service that integrates with GCP, requires less maintenance, and provides high scalability and reliability.

#Setting up custome DNS server on Compute Engine:
In this setup, we'll be configuring a DNS server using BIND9 on Google Cloud Platform. To validate the DNS configuration, we'll deploy an NGINX instance and add an A record that points to this NGINX server. This setup will allow us to ensure that DNS resolution is functioning correctly, making it a reliable solution for future projects.
